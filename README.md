# Lincoln Stewart â€“ Academic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases my academic projects in data science and applied statistics, completed during my undergraduate studies at Franklin & Marshall College.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. **Basketball Draft and Career Projection (M374 Final Project)**
**Folder**: `Final-Project (m374 BBall)`  
**Summary**:  
Built models predicting where basketball players would be drafted in the NBA draft and if they would get a contract after their rookie deal based off their college stats. 

**Skills**: R, Linear Modeling, Visualization, Sports Analytics  
**Deliverables**: PDF Report

### 2. **Disc Golf Aging Curves (Independent Study)**
**Folder**: `FinalReport (AgeCurve)`  
**Summary**:  
Investigated whether player-type-specific aging curves outperform general models in disc golf. Used clustering (k-means, GMM, etc.) and compared spline vs quadratic regression.

**Skills**: R, Clustering, Spline Regression, Model Evaluation  
**Deliverables**: PDF Report, RMarkdown Source

### 3. **COâ‚‚ Time Series Forecasting (M375 Final Project)**
**Folder**: `m375FinalProject (Co2 time series)`  
**Summary**:  
Analyzed the Mauna Loa atmospheric COâ‚‚ dataset. Performed differencing and stationarity tests, built SARIMA models, and forecasted future COâ‚‚ levels.

**Skills**: Time Series Analysis, SARIMA, Forecasting, ACF/PACF  
**Deliverables**: PDF Report, RMarkdown Source
